<!-- # Rome wasn’t built in a day — research at RoMA is built step by step. -->

At [UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/) [RoMA Lab](https://christopherlu.github.io/group_website/), we scale Visual-Language-Action (VLA) foundation models for robotics, transforming multimodal perception into intelligent action. Our work advances embodied AI by tackling **generalization** across diverse sensors, computational **efficiency** on real-world hardware, and **seamless** human–robot interaction. The mission is to enable autonomous systems that operate reliably in **complex, dynamic environments**.
